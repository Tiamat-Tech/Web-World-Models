    "overview": "The Eiffel Tower, Paris’s iron icon, rises above the Seine and the Champ de Mars as the city’s most famous landmark. Visitors come for sweeping views, romantic sunsets, and glittering night illuminations. Multiple platforms host restaurants, a champagne bar, exhibits, and glass floors. Expect airport-style security, crowds, and timed entry. Pre-book online tickets, especially April–October and around Christmas/New Year. EU/Schengen rules apply for visas; many nationalities need a Schengen visa.",
