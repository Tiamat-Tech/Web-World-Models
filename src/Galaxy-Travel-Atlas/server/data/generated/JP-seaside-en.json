Efficient trains and ferries make coastal getaways easy from major cities. Expect clean facilities, clear rules, and delicious seafood everywhere from simple beach shacks to refined kaiseki ryokan.",

    "local_tips": [
      "On beaches, follow local rules: smoking and alcohol may be restricted, and some sections are roped off for swimmers. Lifeguards are usually present only in peak summer.",
      "Many seaside areas have public baths or onsen; wash thoroughly before entering the bath, keep towels out of the water, and note that tattoos may be restricted in some facilities.",
      "Cashless payment is growing, but small coastal towns and beach stalls may be cash-only. Carry some yen, plus an IC card (Suica, PASMO, ICOCA) for trains and convenience stores.",
      "In smaller fishing villages, English signage is limited. Download offline maps and translation apps, and learn a few basic phrases like “sumimasen” (excuse me) and “arigatou” (thank you).",
      "Trash bins are rare even on beaches; carry a small bag and take your rubbish with you. Sorting rules for recycling may be posted in accommodations and public areas."
    ],
    "safety": [
      "Swimming areas are usually marked; stay within flagged zones, especially with children. Rip currents and sudden drop-offs can occur outside designated swimming areas.",
      "From June to October, typhoons can bring heavy rain, strong winds, and high waves. Monitor local forecasts, heed warnings, and be prepared for ferry and train cancellations.",
      "Marine life hazards include jellyfish (late summer), sea urchins, and sharp coral in Okinawa and southern coasts. Wear water shoes and a rash guard when snorkeling or wading.",
      "Japan is generally very safe, but coastal regions are earthquake- and tsunami-prone. Learn local evacuation routes, pay attention to signage, and follow instructions if you feel strong shaking.",
      "Alcohol limits for drivers are extremely strict (effectively zero tolerance). Never drink and drive; use trains, taxis, or designated drivers when enjoying seaside bars or izakaya.",
      "Entry & visa: Many nationalities receive short-term visa-free stays for tourism, but rules change. Check the latest requirements on the official Ministry of Foreign Affairs website or with a Japanese embassy or consulate, ensure your passport has sufficient validity, and do not work on a tourist status."

    "budget": {
      "shoestring": "Stay in hostels, basic guesthouses, and capsule hotels in coastal cities (¥4,000–¥8,000 per night), eat at supermarkets, udon shops, and conveyor-belt sushi, and use regional rail passes or buses. Expect roughly ¥8,000–¥12,000 per day.",
      "midrange": "Mix business hotels and simple ryokan with two meals, frequent casual seafood meals, and moderate train travel including some limited express services. Budget about ¥15,000–¥25,000 per day per person.",
      "luxury": "Stay in upscale seaside ryokan or resorts with ocean-view onsen and kaiseki dinners, dine at fine sushi counters, and use first-class rail seats or domestic flights to island chains. Plan from ¥30,000–¥60,000+ per day.",

    "transport": {
      "from_airport": "From Tokyo’s Narita and Haneda airports, use JR trains, private railways (Keisei, Keikyu), or limousine buses to reach the city and connect onward to coastal areas like Kamakura and Izu. Kansai International Airport links by train to Osaka, Kobe, and Wakayama’s seaside. Naha Airport in Okinawa has a monorail to central Naha, with buses and ferries onward to beach areas and outer islands.",
      "getting_around": "JR and private railways efficiently connect most major coastal cities and nearby beaches. Local buses cover smaller towns and fishing villages. Ferries link islands in the Seto Inland Sea, Okinawa, and Hokkaido. Taxis are safe but expensive for long coastal stretches; rental cars are useful in rural areas, but you’ll need an International Driving Permit plus your license.",
      "passes": "Consider the nationwide Japan Rail Pass or regional passes like the JR East Pass, JR West Setouchi Area Pass, or JR Kyushu Pass if doing multiple long coastal hops. City subway/bus day passes exist in places like Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka. Prepaid IC cards (Suica, PASMO, ICOCA) are widely accepted on trains, buses, and many ferries, and can simplify seaside day trips."
