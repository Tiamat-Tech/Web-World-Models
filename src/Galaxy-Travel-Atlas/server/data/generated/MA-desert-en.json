    "overview": "Morocco’s desert belt stretches from Ouarzazate to the dunes near the Algerian border, with kasbahs, oases and vast star-filled skies. Base yourself in Merzouga for the classic orange dunes of Erg Chebbi, or head to remote Erg Chigaga near M’Hamid for fewer crowds. Camel treks and 4x4 expeditions weave between palm valleys, Berber villages and movie locations. Desert nights can be surprisingly cold, so pack layers. Many travelers connect via Marrakech or Fes and join small-group tours for safety and comfort.",

    "local_tips": [
      "Plan at least one night actually in the dunes (desert camp) and one in a nearby village or kasbah guesthouse for a fuller experience.",
      "Pack a scarf or buff to protect against sun and sand, plus sunglasses and high-SPF sunscreen; the reflected light off dunes is intense.",
      "Temperatures drop sharply after sunset, even in summer—bring a fleece or light down jacket and warm socks for camp nights.",
      "Carry some cash (MAD) for tips, small snacks and local crafts; ATMs are limited or absent in Merzouga, M’Hamid and smaller oases.",
      "Many nationalities (including most EU, UK, US, Canadian and Australian passport holders) can enter visa-free for up to 90 days, but rules change—confirm with a Moroccan consulate and ensure your passport has at least 3–6 months’ validity.",
      "If self-driving, avoid driving in the dark: animals, pedestrians and unlit vehicles are common on desert roads, and mountain passes can be challenging."
    ],
    "safety": [
      "Desert heat and dehydration are the main risks: drink water frequently, even if you don’t feel thirsty, and avoid strenuous hikes at midday.",
      "Choose licensed guides and reputable tour operators for camel treks and 4x4 excursions; they know safe routes and weather patterns.",
      "Sandstorms can develop quickly—follow your guide’s instructions, use a scarf and goggles if needed, and wait them out in shelter.",
      "Keep valuables minimal and secure in guesthouses or camp; petty theft is relatively uncommon in remote areas but possible in transit hubs.",
      "Road safety standards vary. If hiring a driver, ask about seatbelts and avoid overloaded grands taxis for long desert stretches.",
      "Respect cultural norms in rural and oasis communities: dress modestly, ask before photographing people and avoid public displays of affection."

      "shoestring": "Approx. 35–60 USD (350–600 MAD) per day: shared minibus tours from Marrakech, basic guesthouses, simple desert camp with shared facilities, local eateries and minimal activities.",
      "midrange": "Approx. 80–150 USD (800–1500 MAD) per day: comfortable riads or kasbah lodges, quality desert camp with private tent and hot showers, guided excursions and some private transfers.",
      "luxury": "Approx. 220+ USD (2200+ MAD) per day: boutique lodges and premium desert camps, private 4x4 transfers, customized excursions, gourmet meals and possibly sunrise hot-air ballooning near Ouarzazate.",
      "currency": "Moroccan Dirham (MAD); it is a closed currency, so withdraw or exchange within Morocco. Cards are accepted at many hotels but less so in small towns."

    "transport": {
      "from_airport": "Main gateways are Marrakech (RAK), Casablanca (CMN) and Fes (FEZ). To reach the desert, travel by domestic flight to Errachidia or Ouarzazate when available, or use CTM/Supratours buses or private transfers to hubs like Merzouga, Zagora or M’Hamid. Many visitors book multi-day Sahara tours departing from Marrakech or Fes, which include transport.",
      "getting_around": "In desert regions, travel is mostly by 4x4, organized minibus tours, grands taxis and, for short distances in dunes, by camel. Self-driving offers flexibility but requires confidence on mountain and desert roads. Within towns, most places are walkable; taxis are inexpensive for longer hops.",
      "passes": "There are no specific ‘desert passes’. Buy point-to-point tickets for CTM/Supratours buses and ONCF trains if linking cities. Tours often bundle all transport. For maximum flexibility in desert areas, consider hiring a private driver with 4x4 for multi-day routes."
