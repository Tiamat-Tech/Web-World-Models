    "overview": "Nepal is the world’s classic Himalayan playground, home to Everest and seven other 8,000m peaks. Treks in the Everest, Annapurna, and Langtang regions combine huge mountain scenery with Sherpa, Gurung, and Tamang culture and simple teahouse comforts. Kathmandu and Pokhara act as friendly bases with plenty of gear shops and flight or jeep links to the hills. Many nationalities can obtain a visa on arrival, but check current rules. Most treks now require permits and a licensed guide, especially in national parks and restricted border regions.",

    "local_tips": [
      "Most popular trekking regions now require you to register through an agency and trek with a licensed guide; truly solo trekking is restricted on many routes since 2023.",
      "Obtain required permits before setting off: TIMS plus national park or conservation permits (e.g., Sagarmatha, Annapurna). Restricted areas like Upper Mustang and Manaslu need special permits and a registered guide.",
      "Altitude sickness is a serious risk above 2,500–3,000m. Ascend slowly, schedule rest days, stay hydrated, and be ready to turn back if symptoms worsen.",
      "Cash is essential in the mountains. ATMs are unreliable or absent on most trails; withdraw enough Nepalese rupees in Kathmandu or Pokhara.",
      "Dress modestly in villages and religious sites; cover shoulders and knees, and walk clockwise around stupas and mani walls in keeping with local custom."
    ],
    "safety": [
      "Domestic mountain flights are weather-dependent and have a mixed safety record. Use reputable airlines, travel in the morning when conditions are calmer, and avoid tight connections.",
      "Road conditions outside major cities can be poor, with frequent traffic accidents. Tourist buses or pre-booked jeeps are generally safer than overcrowded local buses.",
      "Only drink boiled, filtered, or treated water. In the mountains, use a filter bottle or purification tablets to reduce the need for single-use plastic bottles.",
      "Even if you’re experienced, trekking with a local guide or porter improves safety, navigation, and emergency support, especially on remote or off-season routes.",
      "Keep digital and paper copies of your passport, visa, insurance, and permits. Police and park checkpoints on trekking routes frequently check documents."
    ],
    "budget": {
      "shoestring": "Approx. NPR 3,000–4,500 per day (US$25–35) if sharing basic rooms, eating dal bhat, and using buses. Trekking costs rise when you add permits, guide/porter fees, and gear rental.",
      "midrange": "Approx. NPR 6,000–10,000 per day (US$50–80) with better guesthouses, a mix of local and international food, some private transport, and guided trekking on standard routes.",
      "luxury": "Approx. NPR 15,000+ per day (US$120+) for boutique hotels, higher-end lodges, private guides and porters, and frequent domestic flights or helicopter transfers.",
      "currency": "Nepalese Rupee (NPR); cash is preferred outside main cities, and foreign cards may not work reliably in rural areas."
    },
    "transport": {
      "from_airport": "Tribhuvan International Airport (Kathmandu) is the main international gateway. Prepaid taxis and metered taxis connect to central Kathmandu in 20–40 minutes depending on traffic. Many hotels can arrange airport pick-ups. Domestic flights from Kathmandu link to Pokhara, Lukla, Nepalgunj, and other trekking gateways, but are often delayed or cancelled in bad weather.",
      "getting_around": "In cities, use taxis or local ride-hailing apps where available, plus walking for central areas. Tourist buses and minibuses connect Kathmandu, Pokhara, Chitwan, and Lumbini. For trekking trailheads, pre-booked jeeps are usually faster and safer than local buses. Domestic flights save time for mountain regions like Lukla but always allow buffer days.",
      "passes": "There is no nationwide transport pass. Instead, budget for trekking permits: TIMS cards, national park or conservation area permits (e.g., Sagarmatha, Annapurna), and special restricted-area permits where applicable. Keep multiple copies and carry them for checkpoints; some municipalities may charge additional local entry fees."

        "title": "Pikey Peak (Lower Everest Region)",
        "why_go": "Reachable mainly by road from Kathmandu, this lesser-known trek offers wide-angle views of Everest and surrounding ranges without a flight to Lukla, plus intimate Sherpa and Rai village experiences."
