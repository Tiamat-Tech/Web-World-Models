    "overview": "The Maldives is a chain of coral islands in the Indian Ocean, famous for turquoise lagoons, white-sand sandbanks and overwater villas. It offers some of the world’s best snorkeling and diving, with coral reefs, manta rays and whale sharks. Choose between polished private-resort islands or budget-friendly, inhabited local islands. Days are about swimming, sunset cruises and stargazing; nights are relaxed and quiet. The Maldives is a Muslim country, so dress modestly on local islands and expect alcohol only at resorts and liveaboards. Many nationalities receive a 30-day visa on arrival, but always check current requirements.",
